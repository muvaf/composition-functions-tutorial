# Function No-op

This function does nothing but print the data it retrieves from Crossplane. It is
a good starting point to understand how the data is passed to the function and
how the function can return data to Crossplane along with the building machinery.

This folder contains the final shape of the function. If you want to follow the
tutorial, please go to the guide [here](../02-fn-noop.md).
